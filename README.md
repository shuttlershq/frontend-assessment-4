# Frontend-assessment
As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a take home assessment.

# Test Specification
Implement the dashboard design as seen on this Figma board (https://www.figma.com/file/uqOmwsA3rwIY3jgfFOxdHv/Frontend-Engineer-Assessment?node-id=0%3A1).

## About the Design:
It is a single-paged dashboard that prioritizes graph-driven metrics.

## Basic Requirement:
- Using dummy values for the graph x and y cordinates, the graph should be interactive and show point metrics as seen on the design
- Circular and horizontal progress bar should work based on inputed dummy data.

# Expectations
You are expected to use intuition and creativity to fill in the missing blanks. We will be testing for Skill, Intuition and Creativity

Please take note of the following points:

- Only use Vue or React to get it done
- Any Css framework is fine. Tailwindcss will be an added advantage
- A Mobile Responsive design will be an added advantage
- Also make sure that your project is on github and accessible to us

You'll be assessed based on but not limited to the following:

- Design implementation
- Coding pattern
- Proper Component decomposition and reuse
- Correctness of javascript syntax
- Demonstration of knowledge of the chosen framework between Vue or React

### How do I submit? ###
* Create a github repository, implement your solution and send us the link.
* Create a ReadMe file with `firstname-lastname.md` (where firstname and lastname are your 
  first and last name respectively) where you add relevant information on how to setup/run/test your submission
